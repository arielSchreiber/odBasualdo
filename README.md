This is my first website, made by myself for codoacodo course and  
I have a lot to improve but to start walking, I first need to make a first step and I'm sure that every line of code I'm making impovements

I would like to give thanks to:  
My teacher Emiliano for being good as what he's teaching always and  
to all these guys out there uploading good tutorials and courses in YouTube and Udemy for people that want to grow in IT without them IT wouldn't be what it's today
